# Introduction

A simple simulation app basd on ns-3 for ARP Spoofing!

# Tutorial

1. Enviroments

- [X] Ubuntu

- [X] NS-3


2. Install NS-3

Follow steps in official docs to install [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation#Ubuntu.2FDebian.2FMint)

Basically, three steps:

- [X] Install a bunch of dependencies

- [X] Setup [Bake](hg clone http://code.nsnam.org/bake)

- [X] Download, build ns-3 (be aware that you may see a bunch of `problems`, which are ok since you don't need full features)


3. Make changes

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dark-Rinnegan/ns3-arp-spoofing.git
```

Copy `src` and `scratch`, and replace the ones under `bake/source/ns-3.26` (you may have different directories setup with other systems/ways to build)

4. Rebuild

5. Run ARP Flooding Attack Demo
